## Monty Hall Project

### Project Background:
 - This project is based on the famous monty hall game where a player is given three options. One of the options leads to a prize or a win while the other    two result in nothing gained or a loss. There is two ways to play the game one where the player gets one chance to choose an option and the other way is    where the player gets two chances to choose an option. 
 
### Project Description:
- The idea for the project was to create a simulation that runs the game as many times as inputted (Hundred, Thousand, Million, etc.) and the system will     plot a graph showing the probability of winning the game based on each attempt. The point of this was to find out which way of playing the monty hall       game has a stastically higher chance of winning, choosing once or twice. 

### Project Results: 
- After using the simulation to run the game 1,000 times for both options the system showed through the graphs that when the player chooses twice they have   a 33% higher chance of winning the game. 

## Blackjack Project

### Project Background:
 - This project is based on the famous casino game blackjack where the player is to be dealt cards having a higher count than those of the dealer, up to      but not exceeding 21. 
 
### Project Description: 
 - The objective of the project was to allow the user to run the code and play blackjack within the terminal. The system leans heavily on pythons random      variable to help simulate the random and gambling factor of the actual game. An added bonus feature to keep the game more interesting was to also give      users a money balance that increases and decreases based off of wins and losses. The system would also automatically calculate the dealer and users        hands  based off the suit and value of the card to make the game flow run smoother and automate the math aspect of the game. 
 
 ### Project Results:
  - The project was succesful and when the code is run the user is fully able to play multiple games of blackjack within the python terminal.
