## Monty Hall Project
### Game Description:
 - This project is based on the famous monty hall game where a player is given three options. One of the options leads to a prize or a win while the other    two result in nothing gained or a loss. There is two ways to play the game one where the player gets one chance to choose an option and the other way is    where the player gets two chances to choose an option. 
### Project Description:
- The idea for the project was to create a simulation that runs the game as many times as inputted (Hundred, Thousand, Million, etc.) and the system will     plot a graph showing the probability of winning the game based on each attempt. The point of this was to find out which way of playing the monty hall       game has a stastically higher chance of winning, choosing once or twice. 
### Project Results: 
- After using the simulation to run the game 1,000 times for both options the system showed through the graphs that when the player chooses twice they have a 33% higher chance of winning the game.
